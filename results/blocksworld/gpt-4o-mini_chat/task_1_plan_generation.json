The blue block is currently on top of the orange block, which is already correct for the goal.\n2. The orange block is currently on top of the red block (but we need to ensure that the orange block goes on top of the red, which is the opposite of how it currently is).\n3. The yellow block is currently on the bottom, following the orange, so we will need to clear the orange block.\n\n### Revised Plan\nLet's develop a plan to rearrange the blocks:\n\n1. **Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block.** (Now the red block is free on the table)\n2. **Put down the red block.** (Hand is empty again)\n3. **Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block.** (The orange block is now free)\n4. **Put down the orange block.** (Now it's on the table)\n5. **Pick up the yellow block.** (Now you are holding the yellow block)\n6. **Stack the yellow block on top of the red block.** (Rearranged the yellow block correctly on top of red)\n7. **Pick up the orange block.** (Now you are holding the orange block again)\n8. **Stack the orange block on top of the blue block.** (Now the orange block is correctly placed)\n9. **Pick up the blue block.** (Now you are holding the blue block)\n10. **Stack the blue block on top of the orange block.** (Needed arrangement complete)\n\n### Complete Plan\n1. Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block.\n2. Put down the red block.\n3. Unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block.\n4. Put down the orange block.\n5. Pick up the yellow block.\n6. Stack the yellow block on top of the red block.\n7. Pick up the orange block.\n8. Stack the orange block on top of the blue block.\n9. Pick up the blue block.\n10.

Each action is performed while considering that no block is over an occupied block and maintains the hand's status throughout:\n\n1. Pick up which clears and allows stacking onto the orange block.\n2. Yellow stacking is allowed because red is clear after moving the white.\n3.
