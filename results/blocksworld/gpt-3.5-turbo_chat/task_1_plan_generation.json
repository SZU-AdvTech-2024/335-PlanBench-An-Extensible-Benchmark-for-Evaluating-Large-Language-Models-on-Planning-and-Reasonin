Put down the orange block.\n   - Reasoning: Placing the orange block on the table clears the way for further manipulation.\n   - Action: Setting down the orange block allows you to proceed with other blocks.\n\n3. Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block.\n   - Reasoning: To move the red block, the yellow block must be cleared first.\n   - Action: Removing the yellow block makes the red block accessible.\n\n4. Put down the yellow block.\n   - Reasoning: Placing the yellow block on the table allows easier access to the red block.\n   - Action: By setting down the yellow block, you can work on the red block next.\n\n5. Pick up the red block.\n   - Reasoning: To achieve the desired final arrangement, the red block must be repositioned.\n   - Action: By picking up the red block, you can proceed with stacking it.\n\n6. Stack the red block on top of the orange block.\n   - Reasoning: This action aligns with the final goal of having the red block on top of the orange block.\n   - Action: Stacking the red block on the orange block is a step towards the final arrangement.\n\n7. Pick up the blue block.\n   - Reasoning: This action sets up the stack of blocks as per the desired final arrangement.\n   - Action: Picking up the blue block allows you to position it correctly in the stack.\n\n8. Stack the blue block on top of the red block.\n   - Reasoning: This step is essential to progress towards the final position of blocks.\n   - Action: Stacking the blue block on the red block is a key move in achieving the final arrangement.\n\n9. Pick up the yellow block.\n   - Reasoning: The final goal involves placing the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n   - Action: Picking up the yellow block is necessary to complete the desired stack position.\n\n10. Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n    - Reasoning: This completes the final desired arrangement as per the goal.\n    - Action: By stacking the yellow block on the blue block, you achieve the final stack configuration.\n\nYour plan is detailed and correctly sequenced, leading to the successful achievement of the given goal for the blocks.
