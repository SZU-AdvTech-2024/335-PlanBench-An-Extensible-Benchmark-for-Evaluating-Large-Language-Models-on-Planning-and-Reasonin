I hope you don't mind my asking a couple of questions. Does that mean you would be able to show a transition from the following states (the initial condition: i.e., in this state we would have all the stack information bottom-up and the orange block clear instead of the blue block) to the goal (in this state we would have all stack information top-down and the yellow block on top of the orange block?) state the whole initial condition, \u2013 Nathaniel Nov 6 '12 at 9:44\n\n     \n\n...and every transition but the last one from every other state to the final (\"goal\") state? Also, you're not ordering your actions in any meaningful way. For example, it's not the case that [0, 2, 3, 1, 4] doesn't even denote a plan because you have 5 actions to choose from (we don't have all your conditionals, but I'm sure it's still true). It sounds to me like there's still an arbitrary number of \"or\"s in your actions, which has implications for conditionals, the like being NP. \u2013 Nathaniel Nov 6 '12 at 9:45\n\n     \n\nI have updated my answer so it is cleaner to read. \u2013 DeepNightCool Nov 6 '12 at 22:44\n\nadd a comment |  \n\nasked 3 years ago \nviewed 114 times \n\nHot Network Questions \n\n- \\sum caused \\sqrt to not be slanted \n- Is a land-based aircraft carrier possible?",

In any case I think there are several ways to approach this, depending on knowledge you might not have revealed. If you have a full order logic as in this Q you are allowed existential quantification, so - since you have a 'clear blue block' - you can enunciate it and address it as a 'familiar' case, instead of discount it because of it not fitting your local benchmarks. So you can say 'let x be the clear red block and y be clear blue block', even if those aren't what",

Looking at the tinier stacks problem, the informational requirements are far beyond what is needed to produce a solution. Furthermore, moments of time are not clearly defined, so the notion of going back one step would not be well defined. For example, you unstacked one block, then you unstack another, and this puts you back before the first one you unstacked. So, what do you do, both at the same time? In the end it is just too much work to convert real problems into abstract algorithms. \u2013 vonbrand Oct 16 '12 at 23:51\n\nadd a comment |  \n\nup vote 3 down vote\n\nHeuristics could work. Here's one: remove the possible moves that lead to a state that has no followup-move, then from those moves try to go up the stack as fast as possible (all moves are step-by-step, no cycling through states and working from step 1) until you reach the top. If you reach the top, you're done. If you can't reach the top, you'll need to keep removing more moves until there are only moves that can take you closer to reaching the top.\n\n     \n\nThanks my friend, I thought about some directed graph structure for this but I was struggling to find a clear set of directions",

You have two pairs of instances where an action stacks a block onto already stacked blocks. So e.g. if at stage 1.1.a. the blue block were already stacked with the orange block then how does 1.1.b. behave?\n\nMind your variable names too. Your stack/unstack actions all begin with \"PICK\"; throwing that into solvers will make them go \"GAH NOT A WORD WHAT THE HECK ITJUSYEWWWJSJNEEJSJDJFDFS\" and then they will sometimes (and often quite usefully) strip parameters like that out of sentences in their search results. \n\nAlso, be careful about recognising when your actions name two distinct actions.

However, these are very complex plans. I believe that I need a single plan to reach both the goals (as opposed to two plans, one for each goal). The reason that nodes [x] and [y] have manipulations that I assume will never be reach: [3|[1|f|b]|[[0|b]] induces the effect of sv 1 bec iamphone(An) v 1 iff 1[MSS] where [0 is a stand_in and [] is a cut. In terms of positive navigation though: [y] only has a positive effect while [block|[x|[e|a]] induces ex v 1 iff 1[MSS] where [block] is a stand_in.\n\nThe question: is there a way to reach two goals without having two different plans? If no is the answer what is a good heuristic that one can use start a complex planning problem like this?\n\nadd a comment |  \n\nup vote 3 down vote accepted\n\nI personally don't think the plan you give is \"very complex\". I think it is optimal in size, and fairly simple. The best method in my opinion to improve on it would be if it could use less top-down navigation, but for the great majority of such complex tasks a top-down planning approach will be what you have to fall back onto.\n\nHowever, I think your state is rather hard to read. I think the colour nodes are futile, and your put, unstack, push clauses confused me. I think you might want to do:\n\n[state initial\n  orange is picked up, empty\n  red is picked up, clear\n  blue is on the table\n  yellow is on the table]\n\n[goal\n  red on the top of blue\n  orange on the top of yellow\n  blue on the top of orange\n]\n\n[possible actions\n\n  move?[orange]\\() --> to the other leaf\n  move?[red]\\() -->   to the other leaf",

Then you can just construct\n\nbefore building any towers, and it is guaranteed to create the result. Although I am not sure what can be done with that hammer 'push', it may or may not be possible to place all the blocks in the towers beforehand. Could do without.\n\nNot contributing much... Can't memorize all the rules.\n\n0\n\nIf I am understanding the question correctly and the criteria for \"clear\" only means clear from other blocks then your first step of putting down the orange block should fail.\n\nAnd if that is the case I do not think that your second solution will work either...\n\n1\n\nI think we need the 'move moves' table to be clearer on the intent of the move pushes. When you push something down another block, I assume it visits, but I'm not quite sure if said visited block becomes clear. I cannot answer this question but maybe @saccade does...\n\nThe explicitness of the rules is intended to prevent you from being too sloppily specific in your definitions which provides a navigational aid for the computer to determine a plan, or its impossibility: every step must be a unambiguous as possible so the implication of the step is clear.\n\nIf you drop a block and it visits the empty table before throwing it out when I think your block is a part of the tower, I don't know what happens to it if the table becomes no longer empty between steps of the tower. Consider a squared field with a block at each cell. Would you draw the tower as a square? Maybe a circular spiral? Would it be a 'mis' tower if you draw it as a circular spiral vs one on a single spiraling cell? Or instead is it best treated as one empty circle with a single block moving from outside to inside of that circle and not the '",

This is a very thought provoking variant of the task. What happened was that since I was only able to pick up-put down on single block Xactions at each step, the model truncated the whole task into ~10 steps.\n\nAccording to this model, model space consists of only a small subset of potential [planIC, goalIC, truthIC] triples that have successfully completed in the original ADR model you specified.\n\nGiven that you just said: \"Can a model be taught to have enough understanding to avoid circular behaviour / only do sensible things.\" - yes, it can. This is actually a key challenge for any model trainability (limited to particular phenomena / behavioral interaction classes only). However, I am not sure if this is a TCSS vision and interpretation. To harness all the inherent intuitive features your clever model includes - while competency requirements are practically filled with very legit functional meaning - this task intro needs a new approach. That would offer more challenge of course...\n\nIn this particular case, I guess we could Avatar-Script the task (IMHO, it might be pity losing what you've achieved though), or re-engineer it further to anchor the model in deeper plausible",

What do you mean by stack on/not on top of . In BotsU, contends use a simple force condition that can be modelled as: you can't compete with an item against a block in hand (If your item must be put down, and there's an opponent block in hand that you want to get rid of, it means your item must be picked up before, so if you don't have an empty hand you can't return). \u2013 Nikana Reklawyks Nov 18 '12 at 14:51 \n\n     \n\nNon-interactive puzzles where I can not make any visible move with a chess piece (not even a check) are called tactical puzzles in when playing chess \u2013 user2183 Nov 20 '12 at 3:55\n\nadd a comment |  \n\nup vote 1 down vote accepted\n\nI think that the definitions you provided are vague and ambiguous. Some of your actions certainly aren't achievable inside UCT, not even with DP. Disallow should absolutely be defined relative to the player who's being disallowed.\n\nLet's say what UCT attempts to optimize in such tactically complicated, endless puzzle games:\n\nUCT tries to find positionally winning moves, move ordering, blanking-out, when to counterattack, when to stalemate, etc and more important: a plan of how all of that can be achieved as soon as possible in a feasible reduction of computation of possible moves.

There are two important insights to solve this problem: 1. The stacks are ordered, this makes the permuation invizable which leads to your second problem. 2. You don't need a plan to move the blocks into the correct position, you only need to think about/express how the putting down of the blocks affects the stacks that are formed. Since both your past steps affected the the stacks, I think you should just combine the two plans into one. What that looks like exactly depends on which language you use and which variable names you use etc. It depends on how you want to handle the reverse order. If you use a language with stack notation like SML or Haskell this could be very simple. In both of these languages you can represent your above sets as List (either single or nested):\n\nlet RED = List [BLUE,YELLOW] \nlet YELLOW = List [RED,ORANGE] \nlet ORANGE = [BLUE,RED] \nlet S = [RED,ORANGE] \n\nGuessing on my part of course, though if you translate the Notation to integers, all pieces are the same. (0,1,2 respectively).\n\nBack to putting the blocks together using this data: The natural way to calculate the S stack would be S =",

That gives them a huge advantage which is hard to compensate for by building a house. So I would suggest using more states at each node, i.e. add new strategy states, thus decreasing the search space. Something like this:\n\nbasically modeling the syntax. This requires more code: each move on the stack would require a transition as states are moved up the stack. But then we could try to block openings by state machines that would require a lot of replaying the game.\n\nMy question for now is: how to discover the space of effective options? Meaning, how to come up with such move",

As a result I assume that as long as the action to be performed is valid, some state of the world will result in those actions being performed.\n\nIn this example, I imagine that I pick up the yellow block but then I realize that the yellow block is not clear. Is that still considered a \u201cvalid\u201d state of the world? For example, if I were performing an optimization algorithm where at every iteration I pick some element from an array and then the next block in the array becomes the first element of the array, if for some reason I instead pick the second block of the array instead of the first block, would I consider that state as \u201cvalid\u201d or is the algorithm buggy?\n\nI am looking for a particle collider simulator that returns arbitrary state of particle at arbitrary moment of time $ t, t \\ll t_0 $.\n\nI want such method of simulation that does not depend on how long the simulation of all particles takes \u2013 doesn\u2019t matter whether it takes billions of years to go trough states, or takes only billions of years during t=0\u2026t_0.\n\nFor example, I initialize all \u201cordinary\u201d particles with initial state, which contains their:\n\n- initial velocities.\n- initial positions.\n\nAnd then I want to carry out some simulation of their dynamics \u201cfor now $ t,t<t_0 $\u201d, i.e. for very short time interval $ \\Delta t $ determined by the user, for example, to $ \\Delta t = 10^{-33}$ sec or to $ \\Delta t = 10^{360}$. This is reasonable because many particles in our world have specific signature of initial state and can fulfill our requirements. For example, we can consider it possible that initial state of every particle we know consists or is given directly by its 4-momenta (similarly to relativistic inelastic collisions), which is only its initial (4-)momentum. For ordinary particles such a simulation can look like generating types of collisions (orthogonal or supersonic or etc.) that are possible taking into account their 4momenta and",

As noted in a comment above, the reasoning behind breaking into stack is simply removing or stacking away from the unstackable or desired block as the case may be. Being able to do multiple blocks of the same type might be a problem since the state needs to be able to handle loads of blocks. Is the desired stack a height limit? If not then obviously getting much higher can also be quickly accomplished.

Each state has a block On(this) for each block B, and as you describe a change of this, a specific action to achieve On(that). This makes a \u201csequential\u201d complete plan apparently.\n\n| improve this answer | | | | |\nanswered Feb 19 '18 at 8:01\n\nYosuf\n2921 silver badge7 bronze badges\n\nI like your answer with the switches.

That way I can at least state the thing in the right manner not just using the state of a specific block. \u2013 Tom Sing Feb 21 '18 at 20:27\n@TomSing check with lpadm one of the prototype of P",

There are a variety of solvers that can solve problems defined in that way (universal binding, local search, etc...). Alternatively you can use complexity reduction (P, NP problems mostly) or discrete optimization (graph theory typically).\n\nIf you already have considered those then you should be using automated planners. Creating your own level of abstraction is a large undertaking and best left to the people who have studied and categorized the already existing paradigms.\n\nThere is not a single perfect solution either, i find that keeping the application's purpose in mind usually helps to motivate the right planer design, level of abstraction and choice of domain language/solver implementations.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nanswered Nov 6 '11 at 16:50\n\ndefault locale\n5,57152543\n\n1   \n\nMany of the automated planners, A* probably being the most prevalent, do not do the sorts of computations required by",

I try to create a plan step by step but I have problems with the goal states and the initial states.\n\nAre my plans blocked?\n\nDeadlock:\n\nWhen is a plan a blocked plan?\n\nWatkins (1989) define a planning trouble as follows. A planning problem is said to be under total deadlock or a complete deadlock if\n\n- every active state belongs to one and only one active plan\n- no other state was considered for any of the active plans, since the beginning, due to insufficient preconditions\n\n(Egillson et al., 2012)\n\nWhen does a state have insufficient preconditions?\n\nEgillson et al. (2012) define a state as having insufficient prerequisites if it belongs to a parent plan with completed actions but when going back through the plan there is nowhere to be found a state with sufficient prerequisites which is a legal generation of this state. (Egillson et al., 2012)\n\nThe definition of \"insufficient\"\n\nSince every state seems to have sufficent prerequisites (This means, when I replay my plans in my head this seems to make sense) I would like to define \"insufficient prerequisite\" in a different way.\n\nI would like to define\n\n- a state a has no sufficient prerequisites if and only if there exists a sequence of legal plan steps which would place the state a in a state which would back up to the state a\n\nConsidering this definition of insufficient prerequisites you can redefine the deadlock as follows:\n\nA planning problem is said to be under total deadlock or a complete deadlock if\n\n- there is no sequence of legal plan steps leading from an active state to a goal state\n- every active state belongs to one and only one active plan\n- no other state was considered for any of the active plans, since the beginning, due to insufficient prerequisite\n\nThis means that a state a with no sufficient prerequisite could not be picked up by any plan, because there is no plan leading to a state with sufficient prerequisites. But there is for sure a path between a and all goal states.\n\nTry and Draw a Diagram!:\n\nFor every plan defining several action spaces, check if",

If you want a more advanced level, you might have to track blocks and blocks-on-blocks through time. In a real game, where you have to prevent the human from stopping you, clever chatbot techniques like temporarily redact a piece of paper to temporarily hide a game plan would come into play.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nanswered Jul 17 at 3:36\n\nCodingMage\n1396\n\nadd a comment | \n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

You are right that finiteness is required in order to consider it a planning problem.

The trigger likelihood can be used as a value function.\n\nI understand that you are familiar with ufill, muviz, and pilog. This is a special case of a repeatedly assigned plan problem (not mentioned by name before in PILog). Pillog language by Arnold Rauers.\n\nIs more on the practical application, as opposed to modeling, I guess.\n\nYour first description of the states does not include the part of the sate (front of the robot) on which the block is located. For all the focus on the front when working on NetLogo to simulate PILog execution, it seems a somewhat unnatural abstraction: The planning stage does not consider the front of the robot. Also",

You've got a separate spaghetti for each case, but the two policies are almost identical.\n\nUnstacking is similarly simple, so you get a separate spaghetti for that. You want to track which objects you haven't seen what with them on top of. Remembering that everything will end up on solid ground (on top of something else) is key to creating the policies.\n\nThe first thing you want to do, of course, is ensure safety. This is a simple \"switch pattern\".\n\nsafe:\n\nvar at_error = find(Arg(laziness=~error), lambd[e].4)\n\nThis is the same code now hairified.

Use this to isolate precisely what you need confirmed. I.E. the hand is empty has no bearing on the hand currently being used to interact with blocks/tile. It's possible to \"pick up from on top\" if the hand was empty - having it in hand and empty are not mutually exclusive, only related.\n\n    hand==empty -> on-top(robots)<-[]:empty? -> hand[empty] When you have an empty hand, is the block still on-top?\n\nI would suggest working and testing in isolated pieces. We can be as abstract as we want in terms of defining different game states, but I'm assuming that without a notation supporting multi-step descriptions you're only interested in getting a single autonomous explanation, not that you have an automated agent logic. Having the notation will only support thinking about how to isolate the problem - it won't make an explanation \"better\" necessarily. So in that case, what you're looking to have confirmed with the hand is the explicit result of the state machine logic + the assetion of your hand and its role in the problem.\n\n    before( improved:empty? -> hand.empty -> deny(empty?)) When you have an empty hand, is the block still on-top?\n    \n    before( hand==empty ? red==visible -> stack(drop,red), }\n    ~> hand!=empty? -> deny(repeat(18))) When you have a block ever-present in your hand, and you drop it, put it on top of another then pick up the one below.\n\nIn answer to your question, it's somewhat unclear. Your Model / Algorithm description being such short open-text here does not help and in addition what is the problem you are setting out to solve?

First of all, your goal specification is perfect, and that is half of the problem. Also I slightly changed the state representation to something that I think is more usable.\n\n[S1] True. The state satisfied (you call it statement) is that the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand (I think you mean a 'gap' as this will be used for order) is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the red block and the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.\n[S2] False. The state that you specify does not satisfy the goal that you have.\n\nFrom your description of your initial state (as given in your plan) it looks like [S1] is actually [S2]. Yours actually satisfies both [S2] and [S1]. As a result I think you are simply not distinguishing between [S1] and [S2] correctly.\n\nI would actually recommend not defining the initial state as sets of blocks while I think yours make perfect sense, and defining it as individual blocks, so your initial state would be:\n\n[S1] The table has at least one block on it that is not the 'gap'.\n\nAs a start, let's focus on [S1] for the time being, as it looks like you have [S2] in your",

Maybe I'm missing something because in general I am terrible at proofs.\n\nIf necessary I can amend this question if it is asked at the wrong place if I know why it is not suitable here.\n\nYou're missing something because you haven't described the goal. Intuitively it sounds like \"when the yellow and blue blocks are on top of each other, you're done\", but you haven't specified this. The reason your procedure is wrong is because it doesn't achieve this. Your approach is feasible, and efficient in that it takes counterintuitively little time to perform, but it is wrong because it doesn't end when the goal has been achieved.\n\nDennis\n\nYou're missing something because its an exercise in mathematical computing class for the dissertation and its still in progress.

Thank you a lot for your quick help het your use assignment writing service on your work .. Could you give an example\n\nthe Graphplan library translates any plan-able problem into a Graph plan formulation from which a plan can be easily derived (in worst case in exponential time for any particular plan generation method)\nits basics seemed like a riddle in the dark for the first time .. but you need few lessons to understand the system completely.\n\nthe biggest advantage of Graphplan is that it allows implicit instantiation of discrete variables - i.e a concept for a series of action in a state\n\ncheck http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~dustman/PAPERS/oefP.pdf for few concepts and a detailed explaination .. I wrote a Graphplan planner myself few months ago .. you can find it here (a primitive, infact not even FOIL heuristics implementation is there ..

What can be done to make it more robust or at least to have a reasonable worst case scenario?\n[ANSWER]\nChange the blue-to-yellow unstack step to \"stop taking 1, remove blue block from top of [on top of] yellow\".\n\nAlso, change the orange-to-red stack step to \"stop taking 1, remove red block\nfrom [on top of] yellow\".\n\nI didn't have time to take them all, but i noticed that the other two\nstacks move the blocks from \"[on top of]\" to \"on top of\".\n\nIf there could be more than one object aligning to one another (insert\npick-up and stack) or if there were more stacks to create or more scenarios\nwhere the picker-on-top might be taken to be some place other than \"on top\nof\", I would use ACTION types on these steps instead of steps without.\n\nA workaround that addresses the brittleness would be to add steps to turn all\non top of the piles of blocks to unlocked-on` on top - then add a step to\nunstack the stack being built at dive moment. That will reduce the list of\npiles waiting for the next step to increment.\n\nI can give you a full version of the answer if you want to try out the work\naround, but the answer is ready for you to cut and paste.\n\nPossibly the following will solve the brittleness problem:\n\n    pick up stack of red and yellow\n    unstack blue from stack\n    inches of stack\n    step red and yellow onto blue\n------------------ above get rid of anything on top of blue -----------------\n    unstack yellow from stack\n    step stack of blue and yellow onto stack\n------------------ above get rid of anything on top of blue and yellow -----------------\n    unstack yellow-blue from stack\n    step yellow-blue onto stack\n------------------ above get rid of everything -----------------\n    unstack blue from stack\n    step stack of red and yellow onto stack\n    unstack red from stack",

(Optional) Continue with feedback\n\nI can see where you'd have that impression indeed.\n\nWould it make sense to you if I told you that routEs, the algorithm you are using for defining these plans, does indeed know that it can remain the blue block on top of yellow and yet do a separate part of the plans for these two different targets, the red on top of the yellow or the orange on top of the red. From its internal point of view, it doesn't know that there are distinct actions to move a block from stack to stack, it just knows there is an action called update-successor which applies to any flexible plan which has a way to choose a successor.\n\nYour question in the end is tailored to being about what are the (examples of) flexible plans which exist for a given substitution. And. I would like to translate it as: if I have an initial situation depicted as a graph, what are the flexible plans for reaching my goal situation with different substitutions? I'm picturing the initial situation here as a graph with explicit co-extensions indicating where two blocks cannot both be pieces, and then from-different-xo-as-substitutions being given by co-extensions intersecting the continuation blocks at a node of the transition directed graph.\n\n\"From its internal point of view, it doesn\u2019t know that there are distinct actions to move a block from stack to stack\" - yeah I thought this would happen. Now that I think of it, this means it doesn't really care if your goal is to have anything stacked on each other. So that limits the way you can solve problems because your solution needs to be able to handle any goal. It has to do a whole separate plan for where all the blocks have to be stacked.\n\nHmmm a separate plan for each goal",

Among other conditions, you can still \"stack\" if you have nothing in hand and two different blocks too far apart. I don't see the advantage of this solution though, since you could always call the \"stack\" action explicitly, ready to pick up and stack the next block.\n\nScenario 2\n\nHowever, if you have a good model and you need specialized skills and actions to combine blocks in a \"correct\" way, you can use constraints to pre-validate the sequences of events:\n\n(0)\n  red UNSTACK blue,\n  blue STACK(grapple),\n  blue STACK blu,\n  red UNSTACK(grapple),\n  red STACK(follow),\n  blue GRASP blue\n(1)\n  red POSITION blue,\n  blue GRASP blue,\n  red UNSTACK blue,\n  blue STACK blue,\n  red POSITION(red)\n\n(so that when you execute 0-3 the blocks are standing up in order, the red on blue, the blue on orange and so on - demonstrated instead of immediately removed. The scenario remains open even for different swarms during the standalone scenarios, since the \"check\" action checks if the objective has been achieved.\n\nThe null token instead sits directionally under the sequence of actions:\n\nblue STACK black\n[Constraint 1] blue",

If so, could you provide some links.\n\nHow I understand it runs as follows: I construct a population (of my little agents), provide each of them a state (perceptual, internal, based on mind, whatever), create a table (rules) of transition so every state of every agent only allows specific states of a new agent. If your old agent is in state 1 and my new Agent is in state 1, we can't fire transition (and we do that often, say ever tick of the clock). I could implement it as a non-transitive graph for very small \"towers\" of blocks. Perhaps, in YYG, I would do connect all the blocks in a very short chain to a table of transition which accounts for the horizonal value passed to each element of a chain.\n\nI plan to see a webinar on ensembles and dynamic systems.

I thus want to know if my plan is valid for the problem. I thus want to know the following:\n- Is my plan valid?\n- What is the most naive observation on my solution?\n- Which is the reward lost by choosing a different order?\n- Are there provably better ways of solving this problems?\n- Is there better way to describe the problem?\n\nFinally, there are possibilities to look for better plans:\n\n- Be less general, what if I merely wanted to have the red block on top of the blue block and I did not care of having the yellow block on top of the orange block?\n- How many actions cannot I afford to consider in my initial plan, what are the advantages of allowing some to start with and how many?\n- In general can I get better plans by more specific queries as children quests instead of the whole task definition?\n\nThanks for your contribution!\n\nEDIT\n\nDuring the course of this answer a proposal for a more mathematically intuitive way and a feasible strategy proposal (in the sense that it is feasible with respect to a computer implementation) for this problem was uncovered.\n\nEDIT\n\nWhile this, or some other response, is nice with respect to Maastricht university formalizing a task definition the feedback on the question, or at least its level of detail, gratefully accepted. Such feedback, plus the answers to the questions, is pushing this question towards the right direction!\n\n3\nWhat language have you written the program in? \u2013 A Schwartz Nov 22 '17 at 13:36\n10\nIf you're having a lot of problems with something like this, with language XYZ ... you could instead use Lisp or Prolog. Often they have all sorts of functions which make such problems easier to solve than with most other languages. I mean, even though your problem looks simple",

You have an action RePickUp and an action Unstack. There is no reason you cannot re-use the same action in a different state.\n\nA planner should be able to plan long, deeply nested plans like follows. It will be most efficient to have a single RePickUp action and a simple Rule to test for the an empty hand. This allows a single unstack action that can be used in many places throughout the plan.\n\nThis is:\n\n- Disjunctive State Space Search, and\n- Reuse of the same low level steps no matter what state the agent is in.\n\nImagine for a moment how Gmail works. The software must allow multiple email drafts so that a user can work on more than one at a time.

For an example if I have stack_make S a b then only the a\u2019s and b must be set as the | (or) of a and b must be true.

I have now submitted the plan. I will go back and back and update on how my plan executes.\n\n@mauriciopeggiorin interesting game. I like the two constraints on each level that concerns stacking and non-stackable blocks. This reminds me of the Google GoogleVidaday challenge but with slightly different rules and domain.\n\nI like your plan and how on level 2 the red block is reverse striped and how the blue block and orange block \"divide\".\n\nAre the yellow blocks on top of orange and red stackable in this formulation?\n\nThe game does seem a little bit tricksy given the initial state setup for the first level is a single block on the table and no move. Can one should first move that block to the hand not the table first?\n\nRows and columns could become obstacles. The order is important as each stack level has to be constructed in this progressive order.\n\nAre there mountains that push blocks off the table?\n\nIs there mobility? E.g. can I launch blocks across the table?\n\nIn my examples I have just treated blocks that are next to each other as being on top of each other. Poking around I found this though https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2884393/block-stacker-need-to-transfer-a-block-without-blocking-block-usual-n-m-u-r-c\n\nBlocks being stacked are only one talle that are on top of each other.\n\nA Hill is a layer of a stack.\n\nI assume no moving of blocks.\n\nThank you for this description below. Finally I have a second player to play against :)\n\nInteresting twist in keeping the colors one per row and column. Not a problem, seen that sort of thing before",

For example if you let the player unstack two blocks : be able to pick up and place a single block at a time; if he stacks it to the first block (same color or not) then unstack is illegal. You need cut : some stacking states are reachable from at least two stacked-up-blocks states only thanks to two cut actions ; your plan may spawn many from a root iff state, but will be limited to reachable cut actions stack or unstack. You must however store the noise set together with stack and unstack. It may sound complicated, but it's much easier than it is to describe ;)\n\nPS: I don't know how to use AlphaGO-like minimax to make deep plans(??). Given you could search in all reachable iff states, you would still need AI-proven-connectable moves.\n\nA cut action starting implementation algorithm\n\n- Make a tree\n- Connect action or iff_state, generating a connected action\n- Adding cut states\n- Check 1 if tree is not bottomless\n- End.\n\nConnected action generation is trivial in your case... My approach, to make the generated plan a trusted AI move on iff state, is to generate iff states corresponding\nt o connected iff states before ok ones : If generated iff states are\nvalid, it may find state sets reachable through only validated iffactions.\n\nConnected iff states might be unreachable so the tree is bottomless.\nYMMV.\n\n{\" I don't use random actions.vs.wasd>Else} I implemented small\nprototypes from \"agent languages",

The simplest blocks I have thought of include block A on top of block B, block A to the right of block B. A single block is not marginal. Two marginal blocks have no gaps or overlap between them when placed on the table. \u2013 user171147 Feb 23 '16 at 5:05 \n1\n@Stanislav \"the top one corresponds to the base of one BP which is being grown from it and the bottom one corresponds to the top of a different BP\". You also mentioned that \"The analogy is with epidermis and root growth, in which each root has a single leader but can divide into many. The \"standard BP\" has one root type, but can be broken down into two things (a \"leader\" and a pool of possible \"branches\"). If I am reading this correctly, you are relating this to leader handling. I don't concur with the comparison made here. Please explain. \u2013 user171147 Feb 23 '16 at 5:13 \n1\nAs far as forming the interesting blocks, I watched my niece play the game and I couldn't figure this one out. For example, what if there are blocks arranged in a tree like pattern and the positions of these blocks are such that the on going search is getting stuck. Yes indeed, some branches of the trees have branches of their own and hence on going search cannot detect these patterns. \u2013 user171147 Feb 23 '16 at 8:03\n1\nInteresting. I've only just become aware of the existence of the game, and can't see why it isn't hard for",

My plan tells me that by repeating those actions, my goal state will be achieved. However, both plans give that the only resulting state is where all the colours have been put on top of each other.

When you stack, you have both your hands occupied. If by \"stack\", you mean picking up and putting down, you can't use it in that sentence in the way you're intending to use it. \"Stack\" always refers to putting leaves on top of leaves.\n\nThe only value that holds when you pick up red is //HandEmpty= true, but that doesn't mean that it is possible. Let's say you do not have any blocks, red is on top of another block, not covered by any other block, and is cleared. And your hand is empty. What you are proposing is: Pick up red --> unstack it.\n\nLet's look at the above 'stage' of your plan and rewrite your plan as follows:",

Are there any recommended ways and resources of learning about these types of planning problems?\n\nYou might be interested in tasks with \"normal form\" 2D puzzle variants, like schachmaty.ru/factors/. Questions like that, finding a piece cannot follow a move because it is already \"in play\", are essentially 2D puzzle solving - Bravo for finding that connection!\n\n$\\begingroup$\n\n@Dcoetzee, the \"normal form\" 2D puzzle seems to be specifically about the DagZ (I think I have heard that before). Good find. It looks extremely challenging. Especially because one needs to solve the puzzle eyes closed. Do you know if there is a tool or some recommendation to suggests a place for each tile? I find the problem with your suggestion to be: it is \"hard\" and \"complex\". I would like to address my question with a more modest problem.\n\n$\\endgroup$\n\nYoav\n\n$\\begingroup$\n\n@Yoav \"hard\" and \"complex\" are actually positive traits in a computational sense. You got a hard problem and because of that you will allways be able to put some computational power into solving it. Complexity becomes an issue if there are too many objects and state transitions to prevent you from a complete enumeration of possible world-states. Introductory tasks don't necessarily need to be auto-generation-able because prior art can be generated from rules. But good luck on your endeavor for a good problem.\n\n$\\endgroup$\n\nDcoetzee\n\n$\\begingroup$\n\nI second Dcoetzee's intuitions here. If you feel it is useful, you can certainly \"lead in\" to this with questions about simpler puzzles (between adjacent blocks that have all been placed down) in the general venue here to try to \"lead in.\" A good strategy game results partly from considerations like \"If the opponent plays like this, I believe that what I want to play is a counter of this and this rather than a counter of that and that\" or similar, and that is what knowing the normal form pieces achieves, even if you can't solve it.\n\n$\\endgroup$\n\nclarinetist\n\nI",

I assume, with \"putting on top of\" you only allow stacking when you will not get in a situation where you have A => recieving B => giving B to C => R -> W = A, and if there are no possibilities to stack the blocks also when holding some block in your hand and then receiving a second block, so you either put down sth. or cross some sth. or both together.\n\n- Are the blocks one on top of the other?, can they \"stick together\"?, can there influence physical limits before they break or on the other hand will get blocked/stacked because two blocks are too heavy to lift at the same time.\n- Can the blocks before sorting, even with these block settings be still picked up by someone elses hand? otherwise the yellow block could be lift",

Presumably you have planned for the yellow block to take a particular sequence of actions, such that it takes up where the human would leave off.\n\nI believe your problem arise because you have not completely sussed out the rough flow of the black operations, which I will show below.\n\nPick up red and hold it\n\nThen pick up orange and hold it\n\nPick up yellow and",

It's very counter-intuitive that there would be some states unreachable from (initial state, goal state), because in the worst case, you should be able to swap some pairs of blocks endlessly.\n\nkasperhj October 3, 2017 at 6:19 PM\n\nFirst question: Yes.\nWhat you have done is show that there is a win state for the following payoff functions:\n\n(1 - ) (1 - ) ( )\n\n(1 - ) ( ) (1 - )\n\n(1 - ) ( ) ( )\n\n(i.e. the functions that count the blocks learned)\n\nThese are the payoff functions that imply a finite sequence of steps using only the transfers covered by the rules. So your plan should get work on blocks 2 and 3 of your goal state eventually.\n\nThird question: Reachability diagrams are only for finite state machines, which means you can define bounds for the reachability behaviour (i.e. time and moves) and be assured that you will eventually test/reach those bounds and notice that you fail.

Here's my proposed solution:\n\nStart from one out of 6 positions (blue, yellow, orange, blue and yellow, . . .. each of them being populated with 2 clear blocks) with all other blocks being on the table. Let's call this state $S_i = (a, b, c, d, e)$ (a if the blue block is on top, b if the yellow block is on top and so on).\n\nIdentify a starting state $S_i$ where one of the positive states is possible (blue on top) (if all positions are positive, choose randomly).\n\n- pick up the blue block, with which continue with the state $S_i$ from above.\n- from there choose which of the two cases happens next\n- in the first case, choose randomly. In the other case examine all combinations of the remaining 4 blocks. Each of them may give only one correct combination.\n- continuing in the second case you will guarantee no possible future violations. So end.\n- repeat from step 3.\n\nThere will be one secure outcome. If this outcome is not satisfactory fine-tune the set of possible cases (and processing combination of them).\n\nThis seems to work and is guaranteed to work as illustrated by a fastest possible path:\n\n(S1 say: blue on top, yellow on top, o on t, b on t)  ->  (S2 say: y, b, o, b on t) -> (S3 say: y, b, o, y on t, b on o)  -> (S4 ...\n(from S1)        p\n(y-b-oo-b on t) -> (S2)    ab.\n(y-b-oy-b on t) -> (S3)    ab.\n(y-o y-oy-b on t) -> (S4)\n(y-o-b-oy, o on t)",

I understand the REACHIND part of the problem, but what about IND's approach? From my [PLAN] block, is it safe for me to assume that the goal will be reached as well? I tried setting a parameter qu in the [PLAN] block to stop it earlier, and it did stop before allowing me to put down the blue and orange blocks leading to the goal state. Thus, I am unsure if REACHIND can help me at all. Also, REPIND has found contradictions in all of my REACHIND solutions, so it cannot be used either.\n\nThis problem should be relevant to this site, as many students, like myself, are at various stages of learning about search strategies.

These include assumptions that the programming language provides whatever structures you need (such as if/elif/else statements), that variables and data types can be easily converted into equivalent logic representations (for checking, etc.), and there are various conditions that result from converting text into logic. So practically any general (and general is implied; a simple business system might not need to go this far) computer language will need to make some of these assumptions about plan structure exactly as you've placed them.\n\nThis just seems like a really complicated and somewhat specialized form of dynamic programming, so I'd just take a look at that, as well as containers and array/multidimensional arrangements. Much of this is covered in mathematics education, including topics like ordered pairs, tuples, equality comparison in lists, and other logical structures, so I would read up on that from various online sources, and focus on the \"language\" to make sure the data is mostly appropriately equivalent. If there are problems converting things into types such as lists, arrays, etc., try using term-regular expressions (i.e. noun phrase + verb phrase + present tense + past-tense + adjectival systems) to convert and check things using a programming language.\n\nIf you think",

I think your plan of interrogating the state of all blocks ahead of performing your moves is a good start, keep that and encode the individual constraints into a tree pruning rule. For example, your top-down heuristic could examine node depth versus walkDistance where walkDistance is the number of moves involved in reaching the node, discounting moves cluttering a stack or blocked state. But you will initially have to specify your heuristic and then tune it as you experiment.\n\nFundamentally, you will need to implement \"Plan A\" for each goal that you have which ignores unstacked bonus points and \"Plan B\" which awards bonus points for unstacked blocks. Then you will win or lose depending on how well each plan perform",

Your language is a little confusing and your initial scheduling is not overly elegant. How can the red block be on the table if your initial conditions include that the red block is on top of the orange block... May I suggest step 2 and make the red block on top. Your chaining of recipes/kitchen orders looks to be a little harsh, a cylinder in one room is well diffrent from smashing a block in the other room... \u2013 overdriver Dec 16 '14 at 3:46\n2\n@innocentchild I should point out that while you have changed second recipe from \"engage mind\", to \"unpack\", you did not format the escaped \" to a single '. Also you loose the ability to use them at all in recipe terms. You should likely actually go through the definitions and change all recipes to be term recipes to be as simple as possible instead of recipes that have side effects. Look at waiting, rooms, resources, and mk kitchen defining all of the recipes added there as term recipes and removing their side effects if possible. \u2013 overdriver Dec 16 '14 at 4:24 \n1\n@innocentchild Further Spyne's knife expression should be ~> for all recipe types. \u2013 overdriver Dec 16 '14 at 4:28\n2\n@ictid If a definition is in the color blue, then I too assume that it is a code :) if gift then is now blue the value gift. \u2013 innocuouschild Dec 16 '14 at 4:40\n1\n@ictid no, I try to get all boxes up at the end, and having to shift every single box from a temporary \"pile\" would be a bummer.

So the important thing is, did the selected action in the chosen plan produce the required state change? If so then that was the right plan.\n\n- Then you also more or less proved it by comparing the generated paths.\n\nHowever under some goals where the blocks need to be stacked into various ways, a single state change (given a single plan) seems insufficient. But it does need to move a state from the initial one to the goal.",

I am trying to make sure that I understand how Turing works enough to create the solver for the game... but I am getting kinda confused.\nWhat makes you think finding Turing's inverse is hard? We don't have to compute Turing (or any other TM) inverse exactly, I am fine as long as the solution I got with it isn't optimal...\nAlso the solution with Turing has to be much simpler than with Jenova (of course) but if it is that complicated, Turing is useless for my purposes. (But I still want to try to create theorem prover in Turing...) Problem is, I don't know by how much it has to be simpler or if Turing isn't able to do simple enough solutions at all... It can simulate any TM up to a relative constant of provable speedup. Which means there should be some Turing solution either written down and explicit or impossible to write down and not provable to be there. Hence I think just looking at the input for Turing and looking at the example output should lead to identifying the problem. This is where the Turing program is Turing-complete but it isn't too difficult to describe its behavior. After that you can take any possible solution and see how to reach it in the Turing program. Then there should be a solely Turing solution for the problem. I can have proof now that Turing functions just can't solve my problem... thanks. My solution with Turing seems to go like 3N2 + N^4 + blah ... It works, but it runs for ever (I needed 24 hours just to run it once) Any way for proving a Turing function useless and get invited to leave the forum? - - - Updated - - - Do games usually talk about a Turing theme?

This way, the transition will be constructed automatically.\n- You can add the separate transition with a condition skip = true without action. It will not insert the unstack from top of block effect in the transition. But the reasoning engine will apply it conditionally when it is removed from the stack.\n- In Kaleidolog there is a diverge trigger. If there is no exit action in the plan (in both plans) this action will be applied instead. This action is generated because of the divergance; there was actually no plan where both statements can be satisfied. You can use it to manually apply unstack and put_down actions when you diverged.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nedited Sep 4 '13 at 14:34\n\nanswered Sep 3 '13 at 22:54\n\nRobert Gaal\n25618\n\nadd a comment |  \n\nDid you find this question interesting?

The system graph is much easier to extend to multiple blocks, if we add some further constraints, so let me adapt wolfhelm's idea to this general form.\n\nConsider a block with center $c$ and radius $r$. The freedom in picking it up means that we need to specify one point $t \\in \\{(c+r,-r),(c-r,-r),(c,-r+r),(c+r,-r+r)\\}$ that the robot can stand at in order to pick the block up, and similarly for the other logical operations. These points are illustrated in the figure.\n\n(t.0)^  x,y = (c+2r,0),\n(t.1)    x,y = (r,-r),\n(t.2)    x,y = (c-r-r,0),\n(t.3)    x,y = (c-r+r,0),\n(t.4)    x,y = (c+r-r,0),\n(t.5)    x,y = (-r,-c+2r),\n(t.6)    x,y = (r,c+r-r),\n(t.7)    x,y = (c,2r-r),\n(t.8)    x,y = (c,r-r),\n(t.9)    x,y = (c-2r,-r),\n(t.10)   x,y = (c,-r+r),\n(t.11)   x,y = (-r,-c-r+r),\n(t.12)   x,y = (-r,-2r-r),\n(t.13)   x,y = (-r,-r+r).\n\nNow, the fact that a block should be on top of another block implies we should be able to pick up the top block without any problems.

After all, you develop a plan of depth 4.\n\nHowever, the plan you produce is effectively \"random\". I say effectively because when you do arrive at a block, your action can only be \"+P 1\". The reason is that you have constraint that you can only take up 2 actions per turn. However you have 7 block types you want to manipulate each turn.\n\nHere are a numbers of suggestions to get identified knowledge you can add to your plan. All these should be instants since if you can't find a type b you won't find one for later stages.\n\n- Instantiate \"+P 1\" with +P 1_1\" and +P 1_2\". This would mean that if you can't lift1, you check use lift 2 and so on. Later in the plan you would perform whatever action matches the instantiated disjunct.\n- Instantiate \"+P 1\" with \"+P 1_2\" only, and the same for lift 2 and so on. You can later create disjuncts describing the action you want to perform for each lift.\n- Focus on the hand, filling it with whatever you can. Start lifting from the bottom up. Then you can create a plan that has a good chance of working out. If you pick whatever block is convenient to create a stack of 3, and that's impossible, you can still return on your previous lift.\n- As you say you are willing to keep adding actions, use the PlanAnalyzer program to find a set of Heuristics that apply your actions correctly. The first 2 suggestions above should work.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nedited Oct 17 '12 at 12:06\n\nanswered Oct 17 '12 at 11:10\n\nay",

So lets have a laugh and appreciate one favorite/humorous/appreciable amalgamation of AI.\n\nFor me, Sunda Kimura's childhood AI from the fast-paced space-opera anime Log Horizon. As she totes all around, together they venture into digital space, hacking and living the mind-bending life that it is to be sentient, with a heavy philosophical outlook/views, and the natural wonderment that follows. They first encounter by chance high-level athletics thrown off in Sunda's caste-class, that leaped within 0.01 seconds, sped around and then stopped, as she slid to a stop in shock, nearly dripping over the edge of the platform, the AI hurls into the fray, looking who the culprit was and his quip, before revealing nothing amiss, save for a golden nail, and sets foot onto an instituting light pillar, ultimately forming part and parcel of Sunda, as she is forced off the cliff and into another City in the middle of the Square/Maze.\n\nAfter the godlike dissolving of the Great Cathedral, Sunda is absorbed into irreversible death by means of saving her family as a recursive part of her life AI personal server is defeated afteremathly.

I have tried to incorporate a Sokoban approach but that seems to fail miserably, I am close to failing on the first step. Before I pursue a Sokoban approach further I want to check if there is any other approach that is simple that I am missing\n\nHi Mark,\n\nYou have a nice example setup \u2013 I often find it difficult to come up with good such examples myself!\n\nIn general, it appears that to achieve the goal, a less efficient path is necessary. Look at your moves up to the point where the orange block falls off:\n\n[plan_red]\nstack red onto blue\n[plan_yellow]\nunstack blue from yellow\nstack yellow\n\nThroughout these moves, a hand is available, but indeed, on a second hand, there is no way to re-stack the orange block onto the blue one, as it has fallen off the edge of the table. The command \u2018table\u2019 is indeterminate with respect to !!shape when \u2018table\u2019 is a legal location, but the table action makes an assumption that moving the object off of the table will create a table action, so a potential ambiguity could be introduced.\n\nAs a sanity check, let\u2019s try to prove the statement manually. Since the statement is true after stacking the red block onto the blue stack, we can assume that the top blocks appear correctly colored: i.e. a block on the bottom of a stack has an \u2018id\u2019 of 1, and the top of a stack is 3.

The player cannot see on which order these blocks had been swapped. The MRL walks through each step in a consistent way, applying rules and laws of physics to each chunk of block movement. The MRL expects that each block pile will remain stable during the entire block movement as described in the problem. The MLR is not able to walk through each possible initialization order for each step of the player's plan. To solve this problem remove the Heat effect with strength 0.1 and as suggested by KChauhan walk through each possible Initialization order that can created from moment to moment by actions of the player.\n\nthanks\n\nblocks movebetweenblocks blocksstack\n\nshare|improve this question\nedited Apr 9 at 0:41\nasked Apr 8 at 0:33\n\nJan Morrier\n315\n\nadd a comment |  \n\n3 Answers \n\n2\n\nMRL is designed to",

Repeating this until all the blocks but the blue block are on top will cause the blue block to get to the top (and you can simply swap the blue block and the top block that got there). Blocks stop being clear when they are no longer on top? We should probably have a BLOCK-OR-NO-BLOCK predicate for switches as well as for lying flat.\n\nSo your goal is to have a free hand and a blue block on top of a red block. If you haul the orange onto the blue and then do BLOCK-OR-NO-BLOCK-BLOCK onto the red, you'll get a situation where you have a complete stack of blue (or orange) on top of red but you have a move off the table. You can then use STACK out of STACK and the STACK-like motions STACK-BLOCK and STACK-OR-NO-BLOCK-BLOCK to move the untouched block into the remaining half of the stack on the table. Note that STACK (only apply only to if the block is lying flat) stacks a block on top of another if and only if BLOCK-OR-NO-BLOCK-BLOCK is true for both blocks. You will need to move your hand off the table and swap blue and orange (or blue and red) before STACK-BLOCK works.\n\nSo your plan has LOADING-AND-SWAPPING followed by BLOCK-OR-NO-BLOCK-BLOCK followed by STACK followed by SWAPPING followed by BLOCK-OR-NO-BLOCK-BLOCK and BACKHOME. There are other plans as well; if this one seems too difficult, simp",

I actually don't see why the plan would not work in all situations.\n\nAm I correct that these plans will always work? What other pitfalls should I be aware of?\nIs this a solution? ( I think I would have to do some extra actions after unstacking the red block but I can't say anything specific regarding those actions).\nAs an aside, is this not also proving that a transitive directed graph is always acyclic? Isn't this the same logic?\nIs this proof sufficient to say that PLAN A is complete and not giving any actions in situations that no solution exists?\n\n@amine.no9i: Yes the result was obtained in this way. But to be clear - we are not splitting it into 3 separate planning problems, we have 2 states (labeled \"yellowBlockBroken\" and \"redBlockBroken\") - these related states are both reachable (even through intermediate states such as the loading action).\n\nWhat is the \"logic\" you are using to prove your plan (actually, its solution, plans are not solutions)? How does that mesh with the fact it sounds like you have actually produced a proof (at least one proof)? - How do you know \"it always works\"? It would help, by the way, to know the language in which you are representing your data and what is a \"box\".\n\u2013 jamesdlin\nAug 6 '13 at 16:56\n@jamesdlin well that may be a bit unclear. The solution is the plan (.plan file) actually. ( I didn't use the word solution before because it's not +complete as you can unreliably pick up the orange block (it can break) and the box can crash otherwise, i.e. if I'm moving slow and am opening with e.g. 1h 2m on the clock instead of using 0:58m when the goal conditions occurs). This \"solution\" contains safe action sequences required to reach the goal giving you the proof if you add pre and post conditions (hence \"biologically safe\") - but the system also handles unsafe pre/ post conditions by essentially +complete solution Aug 6 '13 at 17:14\n@james",

Moving a single block \"backwards\" by alignment restrictions is harder: you need to slide it sideways, then backwards, or slide it forwards, then rotate to its side, then turn it again.

(1) It makes more sense in your two questions to stack the red block on top of the yellow block at the end of the plan to make the goal easily checkable. Then you do that same procedure in reverse order on the second question. (2) Then Strawberry looks at the goal and notices there's no stacking action above the lower block in the red-yellow-orange block set; she rolls her eyes, but then adds that action and solves the second question.\n\n(3) But however, if you're inclined toward processiness, Strawberry will take aspirin and smile instead of rolling her eyes. And resolve to work more carefully.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nanswered Mar 8 '13 at 22:41\nuser5159\n\n     \n\nI feel like these are the best kinds of answers - ones that leave much of the problem solving to the reader. \u2013 qubyte Mar 11 '13 at 3:26\n\nadd a comment | \n\nDid you find this question interesting?

However, one suggestion I would like to make is that you reverse the actions of stacking a block on top of another block in the both questions. That way, you will be able to build three blocks upon another block, and are left with the seventh element on the table. Then you can simply put down that seventh element, and be done with",

But if you call prepare in a step in your scenario for puzzle 1 and you check what the resulting plan contains, then you\u2019ll see that you left out a halt action. If you keep omitting this step, then it will keep working for puzzle 1 until you run execution, at which time it will fail. This isn\u2019t a difficult test to do, but it is modeled after many of our tests in our coverage so that this behavior will come out at a fairly low level, and not show up only where the hand-er uses constraints inside your cucumber steps, which could be a later showstopper.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n1 like\n\nmegasploit (jonathan) 7 August 2017 00:43 #10 \n\n@mark\n\nI also read your followup post a little too quickly. You are right that only the plays for the scenarios with more than two blocks will succeed. I apologize for not catching that. And so you are correct that you should not use any contruction that works for a case with more than two possible blocks, like using an if/then statement inside your plan steps.\n\nTo answer your question about the name of the workunit: I think it is reasonable to use the name of the step you are working on. LifeLoggerDemos has \u201csandomain.example.com\u201d hardcoded into its .toml file. And your plan will always begin with the set x = \u2026 step. So you have a good point and you can go ahead and call it \u201csedomain.example.com\u201d if you like, but you could also leave it as describe sedomain.example.com and then make sure your cucumber step includes the constraint that the constraint you add to the step definition prints yes if the given .... concludes with the vain.example.com,",

I guess that the user in 15 minutes will hardly be interested in reading a sheet of details about feasibility conditions that do only contribute as complexity-explanation for non-humans (e.g. a computer).\n\nBut the instructions give the arrow direction for consecutive moves of each unit and I think only the shorter path that has the same goals overall is of interest (at least I don't see any submerged terms for negative blocks nor any arrows away from a goal in an earlier step that should be prevented - there can't be interferences between goals that are more than 1 step apart in a solution).\n\nAlso 1 player will not be able to perform both solutions in parallel, but as long as you know that the arrow that describe the latter solution is the right one (the solution that leads toward a net-less goal-world) you will endje up with the same solution than if you do them in parallel (although different unconstrained partial solutions in the meantime).\n\nAssuming that both solutions lead to a goal solution then I'd look on the deadline issue first.",

I've been using the futility function [(A) and !B and !A) or (!A )?) and !B](www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A131100) but I'm not sure that is the correct method? \u2013 ericdau Jun 10 '13 at 21:09\n\n     \n\nI couldn't find how to use your notation, so I'll do it the way you want instead. \u2013 Erica Jun 10 '13 at 23:54\n\n     \n\nI think something that would be helpful is breaking out the nodes that have multiple valid successor paths back up the tree. I suspect there may be multiple ways past the first few decisions, and this would illustrate some of your options. \u2013 Erica Jun 11 '13 at 3:57\n\n     \n\nThat is a really good idea. Also thanks for pointing out the NSF article, I appreciate it. \u2013 ericdau Jun 12 '13 at 4:48\n\n     \n\nWell, I've run the solver and it works quite well! I am not sure if I can extend it to a more complicated recursion problem though. This was after all a little homework question. \u2013 ericdau Jun 12 '13 at 16:48\n\nadd comment\n\nNot the answer you're looking for? Browse other questions tagged algorithms decision-tree or",

Attempting to solve puzzles is great exercise for not only MCTS but also universities\u2019 algorithmic courses. Don\u2019t get discouraged. In fact, those plans help to identify critical differences in the puzzles domain (stacking puzzles) and can lead to break-throughs.\n\nThe similarity you will find between these two, is that they are solving the same sub-problem: unstacking blocks until the stack configuration is correct:\n\n- unstack the Red block from on top of the Blue block\n- unstack the Blue block from on top of the Red block\n- unstack the Blue block from on top of the Orange block\n- unstack the Orange block from on top of the Red block\n- unstack the Red block from on top of the Yellow block\n- unstack the Yellow block from on top of the Orange block\n- unstack the Yellow block from on top of the Blue block\n\nEach branch of this sub-problem must be proven to be legal. In this case, you would need to show that unstacking the block on top of the Red block, unlike in your GIF files, does not create an unbalanced stack (zero-heights). Or, equivalently, that the other blocks do not go flying out to one side.\n\nThis sub-problem, (how to unroll all of the blocks of the same color) is narrowed by removing the next-color-unstack method, but essentially does not change the struture of the complete picture.\n\nOk, this seems reasonable. I understand one \"unstacking plan\" for each color, and I see how the 2 situations relate. It does help me understand my plan is not a good plan. I had just heard of rolling your own if your math plan is not computed, and I have trouble implementing a single if statement right now :)\n\nStructural congruence helps a lot in patterns with complexity.

So that we did not unstack the red block from on top of the orange block? (Effectively, I am doing a fishing operation in Prolog to find the result that I seek)\n- The book by Kowalski & Tonioli 1999 that I have claims that the input of the planning graph need not be finite such that the Bachelor's Degree Instance of California could imply California State University offers a Bachelor's Degree. How can that be? Is there other way to resolve this problem of having a \"balanced input/output pairs\"-ness?\n\nUpdate: My thinking here was that for the first instance, our resultant goal is to \"put the blue block on top of the red block\" which actually can be viewed as the result of \"unstack the blue block from on top of the red block\" and \"stack the blue block on top of the red block\". So, is it allowable for me to have [PLAN] and [PLAN END] for a plan summary, instead of analyzing every small step to find the exact moment when pair such as \"pick up a block\" is together with \"put down a block\" to get to a situation such that the blue block simply moves one spot up to the top?\n\nprogramming-languages computer-science logic planning\n\nshare|improve this question\n\nedited Feb 10 '14 at 12:22\n\nasked Feb 10 '14 at 5:13\n\nQuestion Overflow\n2,3011721\n\n     \n\nI really wish mathematica.stackexchange.com existed. \u2013 brian beuning Feb 11 '14 at 14:05\n\n     \n\n@brian",

How could I make my plan non-deterministic? I know I can do this recursively, but I don't quite see how.\n\nWhen executing my plan success, I have two different resulting partial orders. Shouldn't there be only one? I think there will be two final orders.\n\nEDIT: I can't diverge when I am on the plan. So I can't put down a block, if there isn't a blue block to stack the red block on top of. I can't stack a block, when there isn't a block to stack the yellow block on top of. But I can first stack the orange block on top of the yellow block and then pick up the blue block to then stack the blue block on top of the yellow block. I know I would have to lift the blue block, drop it, take the orange block, drop the orange block, take the yellow block, drop the yellow block and then I could stack the blue block on top of the yellow block.\n\nreasons\n\nThe partial orders in your first and second goals are the same, but there are two different sequences to achieve the goal, and there are perfectly good reasons why you might want both of those sequences. See Why do propositional calculi require disjoint conjuncts? for more discussion on some of these issues.\n\nThe easyest way to handle this from a implementation standpoint is to handle it as a single possibility.

These outcomes are split in: outcomes we can obtain when we execute the command and the outcome we obtain when the current outcome is deviated from. Note that we assume that we always return to the original plans once a command succeeds. It means we try plan one first, then two and we continue until a solution is made. If a command does not succeed, we try again. We split the process in splitting the outcome into commands, units and components.

If a plan exists that is a solution, we distributed the procedures of the plan in units, components and operations. But we now actually want to solve this plan. In artificial intelligence you would refer to this as a search plan. A search plan represents the trade-off between giving a plan that is simple and understandable on one side and a plan that makes an optimal choice on the other side. If you take an optimal path through the task space, the plan is optimal, but you might have wasted steps or picks that something that was not necessary. For a five year old an optimal plan is the fastest one, but to model this optimality you need to measure this, most of the cooperative tasks are irresolvable without experimentation in a three dimensional world.\n\n[PLAN]\npick up the blue block\nunstack the blue block from on top of the red block\nput down the blue block\n\npick up the red block\nunstack the red block from on top of the yellow block\nput down the red block\npick up the yellow block\nstack the yellow block on top of the blue block\npush the blue block on top of the red block\npush the red block on top of the yellow block\n[",

I have a few thoughts, but before answering I have to say that I think the constraints on steps and resulting states might be too strong to ensure polymotivity. There are also a lot of ways to solve this puzzle without using instantiated actions. E.g. your solution is equivalent to the following:\n\nmove/red to missing1762\u00d71070 73.6 KB\n\nIn the formalism here I did not try to model hand very strictly. It was just convenient to write the move commands in a sentence without the formalism about holding, and I just let them act on a \u201ccanvas\u201d.\n\nThis might look a bit weird at first, but I think if explored might provide some useful intuition.

What it works on is an incrementally changing states that does not preserve the underlying problem representation as a state invariant.\n\nSo you must use the + Hazelnuts states (which STRIPS knows about) vs + Yeti states you must remember are true between states. So you must compose the action flow (we call it part or chunk or plan all depending on what we mean) as an instance of the +YetiSubsystem, where:\n\n- yeti holds the initial state +YetiPhase\n- plan AH Indicates the plan is a plan to bring a bag of hazelnuts (note, you cannot refer to a Yeti as AH = !!Yeti.SubSystem",

Or, if you prefer, you may include Block BLUE IS STACKED ON TOP OF BLOCK RED in your first plan during which you move BLOCK BLUE (of course after BLOCK BLUE was placed onto BLOCK ORANGE but before BLOCK BLUE is placed onto BLOCK YELLOW). This modification is perfectly correct (I think), but maybe doesn't satisfy automatically the fact that, when I'm moving BLOCK BLUE from TOP TO BOTTOM, I have to enforce constraints, and these constraints are automatically handled by STRIPS.\n\nFor your second plan, BLOCK YELLOW IS STACKED ON TOP OF THE BLOCK BLUE is no more in the asking problem, that is explicitly stated in your asking problem.

The role that the \"goal\" State comes into play is a measure of how we are deciding that our rules and conditions have come to a conclusion. If we were to change your goal from X to Z where X DOES NOT include Y then Z will be impossible because we know we can no longer get X either, but X to Y IS POSSIBLE an",

There may be several students submitting plans that meet the goal. The issue I am having is I do not like AProVE that are being generated. For example, in the first example above, sometimes AProVE asks that I put down a block after I unstack the red block. Questions like that should never be asked. So my question is, how can I determine that AProVE is generating a plan that is correct.\n\nI have appended a log file. In this example AProVE is only asked that the second but 9 questions. I would expect it to find that the second stack of blocks is the solution as this would require no moving of blocks but 7 questions. In addition, from the logs it appears AProVE does not understand uncontrollable rescheduling. The correct plan should be both blocks are on top of each other. I guess the other question I have then is, how can you prove that AProVE does not understand uncontrollable rescheduling. Also, if you can point out any rule AProVE is violating, please let me know as well.\n\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nThanks!\n\neneroth2\n\nSite Admin\n\nPosts: 1462\n\nJoined: Tue Jan 11, 2011 2:08 pm\n\nRe: Block Problem\n\n- Quote \n\nI think the guidelines state that AProve's results are valid when all actions are applied in order. It knows not of control, but there is no principal disadvantage in ignoring the \"unconditional actions\" that may become uncontrollable. Control issues are dealt with by understanding the connections and restrictions between the symbols; simply there can't be information in the unconditionals. To show that a plan is valid, all actions should be obtained and not only some subset.\n\nNote that 2.3.5.2 of the verification report states (and notes that this is also the implication of the HOL theory):\nQuote\n\nApriori does not in any way pretend to model unrestricted concurrent sim14\n7\n11\n\nulation of",

Your plan, almost, exhausts the problem space, but there are trivial parts to the problem that you ignore by your approach (?) to determine which direction the blocks should be stacked (\"How about that last block?\", for example). You will fail to solve the problem unless you represent your current state explicitly - e.g, by using variables (which you actually do, but you're not really using them in smart way).\n\nYour approach to the problem, if that's really algorithmic planning PDDL code, almost looks like you are trying to enumerate the plan with universal variables? Assuming that's so, your problem contains no loops",

Use stacked up blocks to represent a scrabble turn that the opponent has already used (the player that won the turn puts the blocks stacked on top of the others, restacks in whatever way the player chooses). After winning a turn, player adds blocks back onto the stack, pushing off whatever blocks happened to be on top. Scrabble is a USACO problem, it might be of interest to take a look at how the authors solved it. \u2013 Flyto Mar 27 '16 at 19:03\nI already had the brief idea you just mentioned now, having wins (having either your edge block reach the end or having the other player's blocks reach the gameboard's edges) but I never thought of something like this. Seen in another way, to say that you doubled is to rearrange the triple already on the board; move them around, maybe skipping some turns and swapping sides just as one can with the blocks. This is another of those moments in my life were I say: Dammit, why couldn't I come up with this a year ago? hahhaa Anyway, thanks indeed, this is going to help me. \u2013 user6638605 Mar 27 '16 at 19:11",

For example, the attributes for the elements pizza, grass,   carpet are dependent on the attributes ingredients, colour and texture   respectively.\n\nOnto elements are prevalent in an ontology.   An example ontology is shown:\n[ontology]   \n\n[ontology] \n\n[ontology]  \n\n[ontology]  \n\n  \n[ontology]   \n\n[ontology]  \n\n[ontology]  \n\n[ontology] \n\n[![turtle tags](http://gmo.ontologyportal.org/www/onto-elements.httl)](http://ademonsofstrocynology.blogspot.com/2010/11/onto-elements-eulerian-cycle-for-cycowl.html)\n\nIn this ontology council is an element since the attributes branches,   dismandable are attributes of this element but not of element news.   However, leaf is an onto element since the attribute handle is one of its   attributes. Therefore,\n\n- leaf is wholly dependent on leaflet. By extension                leaflet and the leaf life cycle are also onto elements of   council.\n\n- leaflet, leaflet content and leaflet lifecycle are all onto elements   of council since these attributes dependencies are valued against   leaf.\n\n- leaf cycle is not an onto element of council since its dependencies   are valued against the attributes branches, dismandable and   not against leaflet. Leaf cycle is not an element of the cycle of   life of leaf.\n\nWhat is interesting is that a graph which satisfy the conditions of an   eulerian cycle has an interesting observation and is an interesting   example in that it",

If this is the case then your plan is not correct.\n\nThe constraints of Pick up a block, Unstack a block from on top (scanning this into a single state: a stack doesn't stick), Put down a block, Stack a block on top (as part of the same action) require you to have enough time to announce a block to be freed, then wait for another block to be placed into your cleared stack, then do the clearing, then place a block.\n\nUsing a blocked state, I could represent the clearing as: (BLOCK){u:OVEROO, (B(U/D)POwn STACK D)} which will allow you to contemplate the next action while awaiting the third action to bring you closer to your goal (note: though this uses the same block as this requires you have announced both an action to UpStack and an action to DownStack yourself).\n\nadd a comment |  \n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

Thus in the first one, you couldn't pick up the blue block that is on the table and stack it with the red one. You would have to stack the red block on top of the blue in the first one. Similarly in the second one, which requires that you remove the blue block somehow from atop the red one before placing it, you would need to remove the blue one then.\n\nEDIT: now noticing that the first one only has a single block to stack, your solution is correct, except that you have to make sure to remove the red one from the top of the stack before placing any other blocks.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nedited Jan 7 '11 at 14:52\n\nanswered Jan 7 '11 at 1:42\n\nBilly ONeal\n5,50432562\n\n2   \n\nA block that is being stacked on cannot be unset.

His hand is now occupied, so the block he picked up is not free. This is the critical point for the other actions. If a block is not free, that is, if it is held by somebody, then it is not clear. If a block is clear, then it is holding something and is no longer free.\n\nA block can only be clear if it is not held.\n\nThus, you need actions like these:\n\nmove(unstack(y,x,z)) SUBCATS move(unstack(y,x,w),y)\nwhere y is clear, z is clear, w is clear and the FREE property\nholds for z,w.\nmove(unstack(z,x,y)) SUBCATS move(unstack(y,x,z),z)\nwhere y is clear, z is clear, x is",

Instead she turned to language processing and programming graphs.\nWith her ability to quickly get complex code down to a minimum, her deep understanding of complex principles (Attention Mechanisms for example) and her ease to get on with people (often early risers and / or night owls), we decided that a guest blog post was in order.\nToday Laurent, a De Stonier and his brand new company EMQ Natural will have the pleasure to host Elyne\u2019s introductory workshop from Natural Language Processing. For those with only a 2 weeks vacation time a year, we decided a longer version of the content was in order.\nIn 4 days you will learn:\n\n- How to transform a text into a useful and useable data format, through NLP and R\n- Transformation of the data into text mining, quantitative and qualitative analysis through R\n- Transfer learning with Transformers through PyTorch\n- Strategies and models for improved results for Natural Language Generation, through NLG and Pytorch\n\nHow do to write a blog post with NLG? Well, this is for another day\u2026 [since then you can have a look at this great article] The only thing missing? A bit of graph coding like the original article says on coding: Could not open output file: 'wd13000/doc_markovs.log'; Closing output file without writing. yes Having had a drink, or even a cup of coffee and went to fix the generic header he came to realise that running Prolog with SWI-Prolog will allow to recover the output file in a Text file.\nCollecting graphs is like going to a RESTAURANT...\u200b For computational",

For example, the latter plans now wrongly attempt to unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block, which is a violation of the rules stating that yellow may not be stacked on top of blue.\n\nIs there an effective finite state planner (by which I mean, I don't care if it requires computation of all successors) for this type of concrete domain?\n\nLooking for automatic state/action refinement\n\nTo elaborate, it seems that when a state/action is invalid, any attempts to use it in future plans corrupt the entire planning space. For example, the state/input with the red block on top of the other blocks implies my goal to have the yellow block on top of the red block, but any attempt to put down the red block or stack it on top of other blocks that violate the rules above, would negate all previous plans that were introduced. And these proposed plans would forever be rejected. I am looking to leave open the possibility that the red block might be removed from the top, which would accomplish my goal while retaining all previous header placement rules, but I cannot propose any further actions that would be valid.\n\nEDIT: It seems that some safety based planning ala Daltrey would recover most difficulties, as long as it is possible to keep any part of my goal that is not already eliminated as a finality placement. For example:\n\nThe state here is that the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the orange block is on the top.\n\nMy plan is to put down the handle and red block and then place the blue block on top of this whole combination. Daltrey here would eliminate the yellow block, and is left trying to eliminate the remaining parts of my goal by refining the plan above, and attempting to swap",

I was wondering how I could consider a higher level abstraction where I instead of unstacking consider just removing a block from on top of another block (but without explicitly saying the operation, rather then specifying under what conditions this could be done).\n\nunstack can fire, if the ground has been removed from an unstackable block, or an unstackable block is on the ground. This kind of reasoning would not help you figure out how to move this block (for instance). Then there is a technique called relaxation by Frank Harrell, who uses a robust estimation approach to compute the true curves of the estimation quantities (the parameters of relationships). For example the focus is on singular values of the regression matrices. The estimate of the singular values is more stable under noise,or in our case, outliers. While robust estimation helps identify more stable regression lines this approximation is not suitable for modeling the complex system behaviors. In this case the least squared method has commonly greater chance of inverse estimation, so valid limited. The region of acceptable behaviors, where confidence in data is higher where it is better to apply satellite technology, than radio measurements. So in the satellites study is more correlated with inductive inference, which agrees with claims between conservative values. Here the coercive techniques between data improve mathematical structure than less structured functions that are more sensitive to anomalies, which this is part of pie-in the-sky hypothesis the way it is misunderstanding of original Braga.pt specification. Here the optimal growth with stochastic factors is missed when discontinuities in data, becomes localized. This is probablistic, which the Gaussian hypothesis is used in survival analysis by IEA methods (Indirect rule out) where the data is sensitive to outliers, without local \u201clocal probability\u201d.

So as a \"Step\" I have 3 - layer logic formula that ranges over the logic variables, say Var1 through Var5. Since I only have to start with 2 blocks and use all my actions, this layer can FULLY range over all the logic variables variables which is why I call the layer \"completely quantified\". So var5 is referring to all the steps and the whole plan up to the current action of trying to put down the yellow block on top of the red block. Its the closest logic variable is in scope at that action, var5, that has the whole logic formula. substituting in further logic variables for later steps, is called \"retracting\" step 5.\n\nMy goal is then to end up in a state from which I can solve the antilogical reasoning task. So after several plans I am left with a SINGLE ACTION that I hope leads me to my goal. The logic formula for this step is partially quantified over all the logic variables.

Will the usage of the annotations be useful? How would the plan look like without using annotations?\n\nAnswer:\n\nYour annotations do not help because there is no evidence that the blocks 'are on the same height.' When you have more than two blocks beneath each other, there is always more than one arrangement that satisfies the constraint for block 'h' being on the same height as blocks on the same height below it. Consider \"Stack A block on block B on block C on block D\" where D forms two rows of B blocks.   With two rows A is 1 under 2 blocks of height, but A is also 2 under A and B combined. Now consider, \"Stack A block on block B on block C\" where you insert a 2 row block on top of D. A is still 2 blocks lower than A+B combined, but it is no longer under B (which is now on top of the new super-block) and only one of the three blocks is above two rows C.\n\nIf you can constrain the number of blocks above any individual block to two or less, you are in good shape. Even with 2 stacked I believe, the problem is not solvable because part of the ordering scheme can also be formed by making sure that the top of each stack is the same number. Thus I can form the goal configuration as:\n\nGo         -------------\n~B~         |   BC   <\n~A~           BC     ~C   <\n~Y~           ~B     ~C~\n|             BC     <\n|             ~B     ~C<\n|                      <\n\nEven with two blocks over each other, I don't believe this is solvable. Instead, let me give you a more tractable-set of goals:\n\nGo                 Arrived On\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n  \nA/B                   O      O\n~Y~| ~~BC~~ ~>           TBD\n\nBC~| ~~B~C~~ ~>           TBD\n\nB~| ~~C~~~ |>           TBD",

All you have to do, is solve each problem in isolation from the rest, while assuming an outcome in which the table is restored to its original state (i.e. always restore the state before a plan executes).\n\nThen, whatever you conclude for the isolated problem, remember that the outcome",

Also, some more simplifications would make it easier to debug than having to deal with the whole thing.

The type of agent being represented is a \"composite\" agent, which modifies things on the domain. Which in our case is a model of physical space where we can stack objects of different sizes.\n\nFirstly, the symbol a is used to represent the agent which is performing operations on the model (what happens if we define agent = $\\mathbb N_F$ in this language)?\n\nSecondly, we will not be manipulating things in our model itself, but manipulating variables in a meta model over the space of actions of agent. Hence, instead of sequences such as [A = do(A)] it should be represented as what I denote [$\\perp$? <$\\vdash$? do(A)] where $\\perp$ is an action not in the allowed input space of the action model and do(A) represents the many possible allowed actions of A. The [? X?] brackets denote a variable, and $? \\\\vdash$ denotes a meta-navigation function over type spaces.\n\nWe can use these techniques to represent the HAMT model of stackable blocks as a meta model. Instead of representing individual actions as the types of our model, we will define the agent A as first class,",

I am thinking that I will have a decorator of xverb to pick a block up and then using the xverb, xcompleteno to remove the empty container but the block and then a xverb, xcompleteno operation to stack the block on top of another container so that the stack is in its longer form.

A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\" If the blue block is removed from on top of the orange block, then the blue block is clear. So you can pick it up before you put it back on top. Seems like it should be allowed. \u2013 Jolenealaska\u2666 Oct 30 at 12:57\n\n3 Answers \n\n3\n\nYou are allowed to end your move with blocks still \"unstacked\" in intermediate states, and indeed that's often preferable. You should not be required to continue in the plan line from the final state of one part of a plan (if you want to get to the red/gray/... state, start with the plain red gray state and do one unstacking, then do your plan).\n\nHowever, you should not typically get any benefit from taking blocks out of temporary intermediate states unless you are planning to put them right back. For instance, you can't stack a blue block on a pile of blocks consisting of your own hand, an orange block and a blue block: if you take the blue block out of the other block and then replace it with your empty hand there will be no benefit to you (since it still has the same ordering).\n\nanswered Oct 27 at 5:40\n\nBragadocchio\n4,6007 silver badges26 bronze badges\n\nAs someone who has not played this game",

This would allow you to use the stack action without the upper block being in your final picture? \u2013 Jonas K\u00f6lker Sep 26 '17 at 18:26\nYou could try the robot move action. It lets you pick a dimension, (X, Y, Z) % unsigned integers). It looks like you could first do \"Robot Move -- RH on table -- 0 1\", followed by \"Robot pick up -- 0 0\", and then \"Robot move -- RH on Table -- 0 0\". When you post your FM design, I can give it a try programmed in Robot Cog. It's difficult for me to understand the rules as ked stating the FItemList format. \u2013 Ventero Sep 26 '",

So how you are giving three elements to be used? \u2013 user960567 Oct 25 '13 at 16:38\n\nup vote -1 down vote\n\nHere is very simple algorithm for this. But I think problem is not solved correctly. While making stacks topmost element of stack should not be on table. Here table is base line and block which is placed above it is on top of it.\n\nIf topmost block is on the table then while moving stack we should replace top block of stack with block on table i.e. always block on table is uppermost block.\n\nThis seems more realistic approach.\n\nActually it looks a kind of Tower of Hanoi problem. But in that case we are not moving our structure to bottom line. And I think there wasn't stacking concept there.\n\n     \n\nYou totally missed the point! \u2013 user960567 Oct 25 '13 at 16:35\n\n     \n\nOMG are we talking! There is no proper word that describes my mood right now. \u2013 PP_ Oct 25 '13 at 17:01",

So, that we allow the system to dynamically create a new block or remove a block in the transitions.\nThe way to model the no induce action is to model it as an exist or\u2014as a continuous function. Instead of \u201cholding a block\u201d, we have the expression on the agent\u2019s symbol set, \u201cending in holding a block\u201d that is realized through the continuous conditional function on the background\u2019s  symbol set.\nThe state of the world, following the conclusion we reached in the first post mentioned above",

The yellow cannot be above the red in the first case \u2013 DanielV May 4 at 19:21\n1\nBut it actually makes perfect sense for a Tac-then-Ack system to make the first state true, but not decidable right? In a normal tac-then-ack sysstem every state is decidable, and if the first state is such it might not have any other properties that alllow it to predict the rest. I guess I don't really know what I'm talking about. This is why I don't use the SE this often. \u2013 HelloWorld May 4 at 19:30 \n1\nI made a working tac-then-ack system.

I\"ll correct the tacs->\"OR-IC\" and acks->\"AND-IC\" as appropriate, and write \"$\\color{Red}{\\dagger}$\" for asserting the nodes\" histories you want to start with, and so on... be aware",

I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\n\nTwo different blocks cannot be stacked on top of each other.\n\nSee the solution to your program, given in https://github.com/bflow/eclipsebi/blob/master/runtime-src/contrib/jesp/example1.acl\n\n(I modified and completed the program a little to test the concept.)\n\nBTW, you should try this tool in Eclipse, it's easier to deal with and has some are more capable than argument 1.0, with support many OSCAR features.\n\nThanks, this does makes my logic a bit more reasonable. I will give Eclipse a try as well. To get to know jasp works better with the hand over the blackboard and let the students experiment before the final thesis. \u2013 Reinier777 Sep 23 '16 at 15:18\nI play Minecraft and my planeto stack dup into an arena \u2013 John Sep 26 '16 at 8:38\nThe above scenario is not a good example. Simply stack one XX from one pile of XX to another pile will not fulfill your planning conditions. You have to implement the Planning Sathish Rao's link (^_^) \u2013 R.

Each branch has certain assumptions. If I make changes to the branch state, the assumptions also change.

Because the solution cannot go back a deduction step would have had to move all blocks out of one row. Still looking at that possibility, we can use (unstack a block from on top of a second block) to square up all rows. If we cannot use the move, put down a block, we are left with the block at the bottom row. If we use (stack a block on top of another block) we can change that into a row stacked with 2 blocks. But the row to the left has that block on the bottom and the rows below that has that block on the bottom so we can use (stack a block on top of another block) again. That done, the block at the bottom has a clear path up.\n\nWe can use that result to",

What would be the solution to move a stack of blocks?\n\ninspiration planning\n\nadd a comment |  \n5\n\nThe blocks appear in a perfect tower, but you never needed to be sure of that. Every move opens up other options. You can use that to develop a loop where you build a tower vertically rather than horizontally.\n\nOne alternative to the loops you came up with is:\n\n- Unstack blue on top of yellow\n- Pick up\n- Stack blue on top of yellow\n- Repeat\n\nThat is not very efficient because you could be trying to stack blocks and just have them get picked up in front of you. The blocking you face is: unstacking allows stacking, but it's not as bad as you could do it.\n\nHere's another version:\n\n- Unstack yellow on top of blue\n- Unstack orange on top of yellow\n- Stack blue on top of orange\n\nDo that vertically instead of horizontally and you come out having cleared the board.\n\nTowers using bricks you don't have may change the situation.\n\nYou may find it helpful to think of the board as a \"must do\" box that you filled from the top and moved down levels as bricks got retrieved.\n\nYou can clear the board freely if you auction off.\n\nYou can unstack bricks at any time, but as a last resort, while auctioning them off.\n\nHow does this help?\n\nWhen you auction you sell bricks that are not on the right column for climbing to the next level.\n\nIf the left spot is the right column (or darker gray, when all of the same color is that color), it must connect directly backward to another brick which already is not in the row, and is a duplicate of it. This may not be worth much, but may be very good when this clears the board.\n\nThe key here is that your brick could be a duplicate of the brick on the left. In fact, it probably is. If it is collateral in making the climb, it will be removed from the sheet to make the next area climbable.\n\nAnother simpler way to put this is deciding to copy a brick to the level above the last ended. The brick above the level where the auctioneer walked out of is the only brick that applies.\n\nWhen you auction, you need to",

Don't put it in your plan.\n\nup vote 1 down vote\n\nPartial solution: based on StefanO's idea.\n\nGo one block at a time:\n\nunstack(red) on (red)\nunstack(yellow) on (orange)\nunstack(blue) on (red)\nunstack(blue) on (blue)\nProblem: block not found...

Similarly with other invariant formulas.\nTo solve a first order invariant I need to solve and unroll the constraints indicated by the formula into the states where a person can be in. For example if I had the formula G -> P -> (G && ~P) then I could restate it as: \"A person is in a GIVEN state when the person is in BOTH the GIVEN state and the person PESSISTS in the GIVEN state\". I then need to decide that so as to be in GIVEN state I need to be in the GIVEN state.\nConsequently I need to then add states and actions to my PDDL.\n\nIf the above steps is OK then pardon my ambiguous bafflement. As I just want to know how do I create a new plan from a solution of Part A once I solve an invariant?\n\npddl\n\n5 Answers \n\n1\n\nSuch manipulation of the usual answer sets (of the PDDL problem) is in general not recommendable. You might find some information about this in [1].\n\nFurthermore, the transformation to finite-domain search space (which you propose) is also not recommendable as the generally accepted cost of such actions is in practice often very high.\n\nFor practitioner systems, it is in general better to stick to the usual Strips-like representation in order to make exponential reasoning efficient as much as possible. You can usually do a version transformation of your SMT-based solver into an extra auxiliary problem (Strips-like plan) that can be solved in a reasonable amount of time and you can then interpret this solution to your original",

What ways could this plan break?\n\nA quick word of explanation\n\nSCaDA community - the GNSS-SDR project exposes a number of resources deal with the interactions of ground based GNSS. In combination we have multiple layers of time measurements from the raw RF data seen at the ground, through the intermediate samples of the as-sampled GNSS data, processed GNSS data, to finally the hybrid or pseudometrical data obtained through codes and codes phase measurements. These inputs are all processed together to produce observations and positions. Our goal is recognize that the different feedback sources are always pushing against each other and so the resulting observation and position states are not discrete states as canonical graph structures. Instead we are really into highly dynamic dynamical systems that need attention in order to maintain trust in the system and seek continuous verification.\n\nMany times our GNSS observation processing starts with a single fixed point. This is idealized and true enough for the ground receiver rather than from the view of a spacecraft. Here we need to consider that our GNSS observations could come from multiple positions at the same time. That is we have multiple ground based receivers working together on the motions of the spacecraft in a sophisticated, highly dynamic, dynamically modified eccentricity model.\n\nMultiple space based sources watch our spacecraft in orbit. Here all of the readings from our onboard code measurements can combine into our criteria for the GNSS processing (much of the time these measurements are individually and collectively pretty noisy). The weights for the relative biases and relative clock frequency differences, etc... that form from our other motion is the key to the observations that we can make from our onboard code measurement activities carried out newer by the GNSS ground and space based sensors (meteo polls, hybrid of pseudo-metre and diurnal convergence to continuous relative position vectors, code range and phase value measurements). The GNSS ground based penetration is a combined single and multi-static activity in real-time together with the",

By the way how do you get those boxes?\n\nAnd what's your opinion on what I'm doing??\nKingsCleanBack 2018-04-02: In the ordering case I believe that it is a bit easier to do reasoning about pickups and looks like a constant research topic https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/databases-and-information-systems/working_groups/databases publications?publication%5Bpublication%5D=85\n\nFor the first proof I went a bit farther to complete the puzzle.  My smartest friend cut me off before I had an answer ready (the response to them was that they shouldn't ask so many difficult proof problems, haha). I think that it may not be generally solvable because you seem to get stuck easily.  \n\nMaybe it is easier to think about by going through the sequence of actions, blocks, and states. Formally the blocks have a property of being either on the table or not. However check that the three action properties with special restrictions for \"lifting\" make an interleaved state transition graph which is not acyclic.  This should be proved formally, but intuitively shows you need some information outside the blocks domain to solve the puzzle because the current state doesn't give you any information...\n\n\nonly urgent widgets handler whose lieutenant is charging are taking zinc tablets\n\nI almost broke one of my many code generators paddling up stream 40 years and the 53 other people still winning in genomics\n\nlet me look at more of your proof problems because they are interesting for an instagramming way.  lets play on different worlds in instagram for fun.  come up with proofs so the ig phenomena stops influencing money being thrown in the dustbin and stuff. get smart and think in the nuclear dimension if you know what I mean kiddo. \n stay positive\nget a jetpack\n\n\nI am replying a bit passionately but use couplets and twisters for philosophical reasoning using string theory..if you get tired, switch to an appealing hypothetical that a joung girl told me",

Also take the time to look up an \"official\" source of information on Prolog and general programming issues. Many helpful things (incl. recommended references for learning and playing around) are listed on the front page of the toplevel site of Andreas Kl\u00f6ckner. Kl\u00f6ckner's website also includes exercises and solutions for many of the topics presented in his books. Note that a number of other books are listed under Tools and Resources / 3rd party books with a number of reviews by Bjorn Schie\u00dfle on top of the list (see the Prolog SIG Recommendations). Then continue with the site of \"Prolog Programming in Depth\", in particular learning about referenced solutions (with ORAM on the list).\n\nYour introduced rules can be checked by creating a number of test instances, in particular isolated cases involving only where only two (or three) of your rules need to be applied:\n\n1  soal([], [], 0).\n2  soal([[H|T1],H|T2], AB, I):-\n      soal([T1,H|T2], S1, I1),\n      total(AB, S1,H) < _, total(H, S1, I",

The two plans proposed by @Kearis unstack the blue block from TopToBottom. Since state 1 in the OP, the blocks were arranged as: {red, blue, white, yellow}. {blue, red, white, yellow} would not satisfy the goal which is: {red, blue, white, yellow} where {white, yellow} is a new stack. The second plan is also incorrect because it unstacks the orange block when the hand is not empty. \u2013 Vidar Nov 19 '12 at 16:22\n\n     \n\nAlso, in the OP is a test case that you are not counting: {red,blue,white,yellow} => {yellow,white} but the chosen plan only unstacks {blue, white} => {blue, yellow} thus dropping the condition that blocks are not won out of containers. \u2013 Vidar Nov 19 '12 at 16:26\n\n     \n\nI am not keen on these black box solutions, but apparently many people want detailed answers. \u2013 fdb Nov 19 '12 at 16:42\n\n     \n\n@endogenous: yes this is planned. \u2013 fdb Nov 20 '12 at 3:54\n\n     \n\n@endogenous: this possibly should have been tagged as \"returns\". \u2013 fdb Nov 20 '12 at 3:55\n\n | show 5 more comments\n\nup vote 4 down vote accepted\n\nYour plan is correct.\n\nI am not clear on the meaning of clear.

Mar 25 '19 at 17:16\n2\nIt looks reasonable to me. Not necessarily tractable if there are n blocks since there may be O(n2) different states in any case. There are issues of type safety though eg if you are holding blockA and want to stackblockB on top of blockA, you can't unless you are holding both, so you'd need to check that first. You might need to create your own stack and isolate the stack or stack interface from your state. \u2013 PeterJ Mar 25 '19 at 17:20 \nI think you need to inject transitions when block becomes cleared, for example, by clearing the blocks. \u2013 Abdul Rehman Mar 25 '19 at 19:48\n\n |  \n\n1 Answer \n\n1\n\nYou are very close to describing an operation of the stack abstract data type.\n\nAs such, you can not define a single function that will perform this operation identically on every stack data type.\n\nIn other words, if you describe a function using a basic data type, like Stack<T>, you can not say something like stack.AddItem(); because it is not clear which data type is meant by T. Perhaps it's all integers, or it could be any type at all that satisfies stack.Add remove();.\n\nWhen you define a function over an AnyStack interface like this:\n\ninterface AnyStack {\n    AnyStack.Add(T item);\n    void Add(T item, Utterance<?> input); // a hint to the kid.\n    // etc\n}\n\nYou can see how asking the stack for T item every time you apply Add, no matter what the type",

Certainly, placing the yellow on top of the red will not hurt anything. In fact, the move of unstacking the red is not necessary at all... so then, your plan is:\n\n[PLAN] unstack the blue block from on top of the white block put down the blue block unstack the white block from on top of the blue block stack the white block on top of the blue block = <--- CASE COVERED!

After the first case, you know that the red block is fit on the blue (which is not stated in your Underlying Requirements, so be careful!). After the second, nothing changes (well, a red block is fit on top of a yellow block... but I guess that doesn't really count... as stated previously, this is my issue with the original problem). \u2013 Computist Jul 1 '13 at 16:07\n\n     \n\nA solution is to move either the white block out of the picture, or the red block on top of the white block, and then placing the blue block on top of the white block. \u2013 sharptooth Jul 2 '13 at 9:13\n\n     \n\nIn other words, partition the original statement to such that the 'underlying requirements' are clear",

It doesn't matter to me driving a toy example, but there is probably a simpler plan. When adding blocks (a calculation problem), you can't always tell, fixed in position, which block it will be stacked on. If you just knew, god1 was no longer doing it. It's like: if god1 is stuck, then get off your laurels, and add a block. You would automatically get \"god2\" and \"god1\", if you did not yet.
