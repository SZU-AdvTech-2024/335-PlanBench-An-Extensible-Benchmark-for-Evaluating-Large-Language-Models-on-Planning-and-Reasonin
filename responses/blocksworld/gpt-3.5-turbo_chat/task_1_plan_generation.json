Unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block.\n2. Put down the yellow block.\n3. Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block.\n4. Put down the blue block.\n5. Pick up the yellow block.\n6. Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block.\n7. Pick up the red block.\n8. Stack the red block on top of the blue block.\n\nYour plan correctly follows the constraints and achieves the desired final arrangement for the third set of blocks."
